Basically design inherits or reflects the taste of our style. It is the true reflection of our tradition,culture and values.In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity.In actual the design satisfy the feelings and goal to live what we dream.A good design is the one which is not only attracted by the designer but the spectators.... moreover it should be decent, elegant and attractive and appreciated by everyone.
